# Nemo: An Arduino Aquarium Monitoring System Controlled by An Android Mobile Application

Authors: Katrina Anne N. Salvador and Prof. Jaime M. Samaniego

Abstract — The growing popularity of mobile applications comes from its ability to assist in a wide range of tasks and its portability. This study aims to create an aquarium monitoring system that is manageable, cost-efﬁcient, and relevant. This study utilizes the customizability of Arduino microcontrollers, along with compatible sensors, to measure water temperature, water pH, and water turbidity. A mobile application is created to alert the user when the condition of the aquarium is not ideal, display the data from the sensors that are retrieved from a Firebase realtime database where the data is uploaded by the Arduino, and allow the user to control the aquarium’s lighting supply.
